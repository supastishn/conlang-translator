Okay, this is a fascinating challenge! Based on your extensive notes, here's a descriptive text document for an AI, using only Romanizations, to help it understand and translate between English and Illuveterian.

Illuveterian Language Translation Guide for AI

1. Introduction

Illuveterian is an agglutinative language with a primary sentence structure that differs significantly from English. It features a system where punctuation marks are represented by actual words, often based on the pronoun "you" (Cheh). Modifiers (prefixes and suffixes) play a crucial role in conveying tense, aspect, subject focus, and other grammatical nuances. This document aims to provide a foundational understanding for translation.

2. Phonology and Romanization Notes

Vowels:

a: as in "father" (short)

aah: as in "father" (long)

air: as in "air"

ar: as in "car"

ay: as in "say"

ee: as in "see"

eh: as in "bet"

er: as in "her"

eye: as in "eye" or "I"

ih: as in "sit"

oh: as in "go"

oo: as in "moon"

ow: as in "cow"

uh: as in "but" or the schwa sound in "sofa"

Consonants:

b: often followed by a slight "uh" sound, like b(uh)

bah: b + aah

ch: as in "church"

d: often followed by a slight "uh" sound, like d(uh)

ff: as in "off"

g: as in "go" (hard g), often g(uh)

h: as in "hat"

k: as in "kite"

l: as in "light", often l(uh)

m: as in "man"

mo: m + oh

n: as in "no", often n(uh)

p: as in "pet", often p(uh)

r: slightly rolled or tapped r

s: as in "see"

sh: as in "shoe"

t: as in "top", often t(uh)

th: as in "thin" (voiceless)

w: as in "wet", often w(uh)

yu: as in "you"

Special Rule: yu + h often combines to form a yuh sound (like "young" without the 'ng').

Apostrophe ('): Often indicates a glottal stop or a slight separation/emphasis between sounds, rather than a contraction in the English sense (e.g., Cheh'eht).

Hyphens (-): Used in this document primarily to separate morphemes (prefixes/suffixes from root words) for clarity. In natural Illuveterian, these might be written as single compounded words.

3. Core Grammar

3.1. Sentence Structure (Default)

The general order is:
Secondary Subject(s)/Addresser -> Adjective -> State Of Being -> Action -> Time -> Primary Subject/Addressee

Example: "Your brown cat" translates to Rew boraun Chech (Cat brown Your_possessive).

Here, "Cat" (Rew) is the secondary subject (the thing being described). "brown" (boraun) is the adjective. "Your (possessive)" (Chech) indicates possession by the primary addressee (you). A full sentence might be Rew boraun Chech cheh:koh (Cat brown Your_possessive you_are/space).

Example: "I am very bored." translates to [BoredWord]-tu Teh-ahs (Bored-very I-am).

[BoredWord] is the state/adjective. -tu is "very". Teh is "I" (Primary Subject). -ahs is "am" (State of Being suffix).

3.2. Pronouns

I/Me: Teh

My/Mine (possessive): Tesh

You (singular): Cheh

Your/Yours (singular, possessive): Chech

He/Him: Mosh

His (possessive): Mosht

She/Her: Mah

Her/Hers (possessive): Maht

It/That/The: Meh

We (exclusive, a group not including the listener): Teheht (derived from Teh + plural modifier -eht)

We (inclusive, you and me/us): Tesheht (derived from Tesh (possessive I) + plural modifier -eht, implying sharedness)

You (plural, addressing a group): Cheh'eht (derived from Cheh + plural modifier -eht)

They/Them/Their (genderfluid singular): Rhet

They/Them/Their (genderfluid plural): Rheteht (derived from Rhet + plural modifier -eht)

3.3. Verbs and State of Being (SOB)

State of Being Suffixes:

-ahs: To be (am, is, are)

-ohs: Not to be (am not, is not, are not)

These are attached to the word they describe (often an adjective or noun).

Example: Anaash Mah-ahs (Beautiful She-is) -> "She is beautiful."

Standalone SOB/Preposition:

Koh: Are / of

Used in cheh:koh (see Punctuation-Words).

Example: Fehsht-ahri koh yune-eht Dar-tesheht (Eldest of children Possessive-our_inclusive) -> "The eldest of our children."

Action Verbs:

Tense Prefixes (attach to the action verb):

Ahb-: Past Tense (e.g., Ahb-krectah - came)

Ohb-: Future Tense (e.g., Ohb-krectah - will come)

Present Tense: No prefix, use the base verb.

Action-Related Suffixes (attach to the action verb):

-tay: Becomes an action (1st person progressive, like "-ing"). Example: Kahtuh (fall) -> Kahtuhtay (falling - done by primary subject).

-tech: Action performed by someone else (second person context). Example: Krechtah-tech (you come / (someone) makes you come).

-ahn: Can complete parent action (can, able to).

-ohn: Cannot complete parent action (cannot, unable to).

Combined Tense/Modal-like forms:

Will (can): Ohb-[verb]-ahn (Future-[verb]-can)

Did (could): Ahb-[verb]-ahn (Past-[verb]-can)

Won't (cannot): Ohb-[verb]-ohn (Future-[verb]-cannot)

Didn't (couldn't): Ahb-[verb]-ohn (Past-[verb]-cannot)

Don't (command): Ahlntech (standalone). For a specific action: Ahl-[verb]-ohntech. (e.g. Ahl-kehksh-ohntech - Don't touch (it)!) This seems to be Ahl- (Primary Subject modifier, here referring to the one being commanded) + verb + -ohn (cannot) + -tech (2nd person action).

3.4. Modifiers

Modifiers can be prefixes or suffixes. Many can also function as standalone words.

General Modifier Opposites: Often, words with an "ah" sound have a "better" or more positive connotation, while "oh" sounds have a "worse" or more negative/opposite connotation. (e.g., Ahth (more) vs Ohth (less); Ahn (can) vs Ohn (cannot)).

Prefix Modifiers:

Tense: Ahb- (Past), Ohb- (Future) - see Verbs

Time (can also be standalone words):

Towr-: Ever (e.g., Towr-ohsht - ever know)

Towrohn-: Never (e.g., Towrohn-ohsht - never know)

Ahd-: Soon

Ohd-: Later

Ahm-: Fast

Ohm-: Slow

Subject Focus (used for clarity with multiple subjects/clauses):

Ahl-: Modifies a word to relate it to the Primary Subject.

Ohl-: Modifies a word to relate it to the Secondary Subject.

Possessive:

Dar-: General possessive marker, attached to the possessed noun. Example: Dar-rew Mosh (Possessive-cat He) -> "His cat." (Compare with specific possessive pronouns like Tesh, Chech).

Suffix Modifiers:

Degree/Manner:

-ori: Little (e.g., Bohrmoh-ori - very little)

-ahri: Big (e.g., Rew-ahri - big cat)

-tu: Very/So (e.g., Anaash-tu - very beautiful)

-ohth: Less

-ahth: More

Plural:

-eht: Makes a noun plural (e.g., Yune (child) -> Yune-eht (children)). Also used in forming plural pronouns.

State of Being/Action: -ahs, -ohs, -tay, -tech, -ahn, -ohn - see Verbs

3.5. Punctuation-Words

These are critical and unique to Illuveterian. They often replace standard punctuation marks and are based on Cheh (you).

Period / Full Stop (.): cheh (literally "you.")

Indicates the end of a statement directed at or involving "you" as the implied final addressee or context.

Apostrophe ('): cheh'eht (literally "y'all")

This is not a general contraction marker. It specifically means "y'all" or "you (plural)". It's a distinct word.

Question Mark (?): cheh-kwesht (romanization for chehÂ°, literally "you?")

Used for questions directed at "you". For other types of questions, question words (see Lexicon) are used within the standard sentence structure.

Quotation Marks (" "): Standard quotation marks " are used around Illuveterian text.

Example: English "you" -> Illuveterian "cheh"

Exclamation Mark (!): cheh-eksk (romanization for cheh', literally "you!")

Expresses exclamation related to "you".

Ellipses (...): cheh-elip (romanization for cheh_, literally "you...")

Indicates trailing off, related to "you".

Space (between major sentence components or as a copula): cheh:koh (literally "you are" or "you of")

This is highly important. It can function as a separator similar to a space, but also carries the meaning "you are" or connects "you" to a state/object. It often links the main described entity/action to the final "you" (Primary Addressee).

Example: Rew boraun Chech cheh:koh (Cat brown Your_possessive you_are/space).

3.6. Honorifics

Placed before a secondary subject.

Placed after a primary subject.

Example: "I really like his majesty" -> Ickmosh Mosh teck-tu Teh (Majesty him like-really I).

Ickmosh (King/Majesty) is the secondary subject (object of liking). Mosh (him) clarifies who the majesty is. teck-tu (like-really) is the action. Teh (I) is the primary subject.

Example: "King Raymond is lovely" -> Anaash-ahs Raymond Ickmosh (Lovely-is Raymond King).

Anaash-ahs (Lovely-is) is Adjective+SOB. Raymond is the secondary subject. Ickmosh (King) is the honorific placed after the primary subject (Raymond, in this inverted structure where "lovely" is the focus).

3.7. Split Sentences

Sentences with multiple clauses connected by conjunctions.

Example: "I love you more than you could ever know."

Illuveterian: Teh tahaath Cheh looksh towr-ahn ohsht-ahn Cheh.

Breakdown: Teh (I) tah-aath (love-more) Cheh (you) looksh (than) towr-ahn (ever-can) ohsht-ahn (know-can) Cheh (you).

This translates to: "I love-more you than ever-can know-can you."

(Note: The English implies "you cannot know the extent," while the provided Illuveterian is "you can know." The translation should follow the provided Illuveterian structure.)

5. Key Translation Challenges & Notes for AI

Agglutination: The AI must be proficient at identifying root words and the meanings of attached prefixes/suffixes. Word boundaries might be less distinct in fluent speech/writing than shown with hyphens here.

Punctuation-Words: These are paramount. cheh:koh is especially complex, acting as both a "space" and a copula ("you are"). The AI needs to understand when to insert these words instead of using standard punctuation or assuming English-like spacing.

Word Order: Strict adherence to the Illuveterian sentence structure is vital.

Context for "am/is/are": The suffix -ahs or the word Koh (or cheh:koh) will convey this. The choice depends on what is being linked.

"Ah" vs. "Oh" Semantic Pairs: Be aware of the tendency for "ah" sounds in modifiers/words to indicate "better/more/positive" and "oh" sounds for "worse/less/negative."

Dual-Role Words: Many morphemes (e.g., Towr, Ahm, Ori) can be standalone words or affixes. Context will determine their function.

Apostrophes: In Illuveterian romanization (e.g., Cheh'eht, Tahw'r), the apostrophe likely signifies a glottal stop, a distinct phonetic quality, or a syllable break, not an English-style contraction.

Possession: Differentiate between general possessive prefix Dar- (on the possessed item) and specific possessive pronouns (Tesh, Chech, etc., which stand alone or follow the possessed item).

Implied Subjects/Objects: Due to the structured nature, some subjects/objects might be implied by word position or affixes, especially concerning the "Primary Addressee" (often "you" / Cheh).

This document provides a starting point. Further vocabulary acquisition and exposure to more complex sentence structures will be necessary for advanced translation.
