## The Diacritical Waluigi Language (DWL) - Detailed Specification


**Introduction:**
The Diacritical Waluigi Language (DWL) is a minimalist, yet surprisingly expressive, constructed language. It is built upon the foundational morpheme `wæ`, which, when combined with a rich system of diacritics, prefixes, suffixes, and compounding, allows for a wide range of semantic and grammatical functions. DWL is characterized by its fluid parts of speech, Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order, and a thematic connection to the expressive interjections of the character Waluigi. The language prioritizes context and the inherent flexibility of its core components.

## I. Phonology & Orthography (Brief Overview)


While DWL is primarily a conceptual and written language for this specification, a basic understanding of its sound and writing is helpful.


*   **Core Morpheme:** `wæ`
    *   Pronunciation: Intended to be similar to Waluigi's characteristic interjection. A common realization might be /wæh/ or /wɛː/. The final /h/ is often subtle or dropped, especially when followed by other morphemes.
*   **Diacritics:** These primarily modify the semantic content of `wæ` but may also subtly influence intonation or stress in a spoken form. Their visual representation is key.
    *   Acute (´), Grave (`), Circumflex (^), Macron (¯), Breve (˘), Tilde (~), Diaeresis (¨), Dot Above (˙), Dot Below (.), Hook Above (̉), Caron (ˇ), Cedilla (¸).
*   **Suffix `æ`:** Pronounced as the vowel in `wæ`. When forming suffixes like `-ǽ`, the diacritic applies to this suffix vowel.
*   **Stress:** Generally, the primary stress falls on the `wæ` morpheme that carries the core semantic load of a word. In compounds, the first meaningful `wæ` often receives primary stress, with secondary stress on subsequent ones. Prefixes are typically unstressed or lightly stressed.
*   **Intonation:**
    *   Statements usually have a falling intonation at the end.
    *   Questions marked by `wæ̃̈` often have a rising intonation on the particle itself or the final syllable of the sentence.
*   **Orthography:** DWL uses the Latin alphabet with the specified diacritics. Consistency in diacritic placement is crucial for meaning.

## II. Core Vocabulary & Morphemes


The entire lexicon of DWL is derived from `wæ` and its modifications.

### B. Affixes


#### 1. Prefixes
Prefixes are formed by placing a core `wæ`-form (usually one with a strong adjectival or adverbial sense) before another `wæ`-form (the head word). They modify the head word.


*   **`wæ̀-`**: Negation/Opposition Prefix (from `wæ̀` - state/quality, implying an alternative or opposite state).
    *   **Function:** Indicates "not-", "un-", "opposite of", "lack of".
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `wæ̀ wæ̂`: not-good = bad, evil, unpleasant. (`wæ̀ wæ̂ wæ` - a bad thing)
        *   `wæ̀ wæ̌`: not-know = ignorant, unknown. (`wæ̀ wæ̌ wæ̃ wæ̀.` - Ignorance, I, have.)
        *   `wæ̀ wǽ`: not-do = undo, stop, prevent; inaction. (`wæ wæ̃ wæ̀ wǽ.` - Thing, I, not-do.)


*   **`wǣ-`**: Augmentative/Intensifying/Pluralizing Prefix (from `wǣ` - big/many).
    *   **Function:** Indicates "very", "much", "many", "greatly", "intensely"; also serves as a primary pluralizer for nouns.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `wǣ wæ̂`: very good, excellent. (`wǣ wæ̂ wæ` - an excellent thing)
        *   `wǣ wǽ`: do greatly, do much. (`wæ wæ̃ wǣ wǽ.` - Thing, I, do-much.)
        *   `wǣ wæ`: many things, much stuff (plural).
        *   `wǣ wæ̃wæ̇`: many people.


*   **`wæ̆-`**: Diminishing/Attenuating Prefix (from `wæ̆` - small/little).
    *   **Function:** Indicates "somewhat", "a little", "few", "slightly", "less".
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `wæ̆ wæ̂`: somewhat good, okay. (`wæ̆ wæ̂ wæ` - an okay thing)
        *   `wæ̆ wǽ`: do a little, do slightly. (`wæ wæ̃ wæ̆ wǽ.` - Thing, I, do-little.)
        *   `wæ̆ wæ`: few things, a little stuff.


*   **`wǽ-`**: Causative/Inchoative Prefix (from `wǽ` - action/cause/become).
    *   **Function:** Can indicate "to cause to be X", "to make X", "to start to be X", "to become X". Often used with stative concepts to make them dynamic.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `wǽ wæ̂`: to make good, to improve; to become good. (`wæ wæ̃ wǽ wæ̂.` - Thing, I, make-good.)
        *   `wǽ wæ̀`: to bring into existence, to cause a state. (`wæ wæ̃ wǽ wæ̀.` - Thing, I, cause-to-be.)
        *   `wǽ wǣ`: to cause to be big, to enlarge; to become big.


*   **`wæ̂-`**: Benefactive/Positive Aspect Prefix (from `wæ̂` - good/positive).

        *   `wæ̂ wæ̧`: to speak well of, to praise.


#### 2. Suffixes (Primarily Tense/Aspect Markers)
Suffixes are formed by adding `æ` followed by a diacritic to a `wæ`-form, most commonly a verb or a word functioning as a verb.


*   **`-ǽ`**: Past Tense / Perfective Aspect (related to `wǽ` - action, implying completed action).
    *   **Function:** Marks a completed action or a state that was true in the past.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `wǽǽ`: did, acted, went, became (from `wǽ` + `-ǽ`).
        *   `wæ̂ǽ`: was good, liked (in the past), wanted (from `wæ̂` + `-ǽ`).
        *   `wæ wæ̃ wæ̌ǽ.` (Thing, I, knew-past.) -> "I knew the thing."


*   **`-ǣ`**: Future Tense / Prospective Aspect (related to `wǣ` - long time/augment, implying future or potential).
    *   **Function:** Marks an action or state that will or is intended to occur in the future.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `wǽǣ`: will do, will act, will go, will become (from `wǽ` + `-ǣ`).
        *   `wæ̂ǣ`: will be good, will like, will want (from `wæ̂` + `-ǣ`).
        *   `wæ wæ̃ wæ̌ǣ.` (Thing, I, will-know.) -> "I will know the thing."


*   **`-æ̀`**: Stative/Resultative Suffix (related to `wæ̀` - state, implying a resulting state or ongoing condition).
    *   **Function:** Can indicate a state resulting from an action, or an ongoing, non-dynamic state. Sometimes overlaps with the simple stative verb `wæ̀`.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `wǽæ̀`: done (as in, "the work is done"), in a state of having been acted upon.
        *   `wæ̂æ̀`: in a state of being good, being liked.
        *   `wæ wæ̃ wǽæ̀.` (Thing, I, is-done-by.) -> "The thing is done by me / I have the thing in a done state." (Can express a passive-like meaning).


*   **(No Suffix)**: Present Tense / General Aspect / Imperfective Aspect.
    *   **Function:** Used for actions happening now, habitual actions, or general truths without specific tense marking. The default form.


### C. Conjunctions & Particles


These are typically standalone words, often formed by `wæ` + diacritic + `æ` suffix, or specific `wæ`-forms.


1.  **`wæ̂æ`**: And (Additive Conjunction)
    *   **Derivation:** `wæ̂` (good/positive) + `æ` (suffix marker). Implies a positive or neutral joining.
    *   **Function:** Connects words, phrases, or clauses with an additive sense.
    *   **Example:** `wæ̃ wæ̂ wæ̂æ wæ̈ wæ̂.` (I am-good and you are-good.)


2.  **`wæ̆æ`**: Or (Alternative Conjunction)
    *   **Derivation:** `wæ̆` (small/choice) + `æ` (suffix marker). Implies a choice between alternatives.
    *   **Function:** Connects alternatives.
    *   **Example:** `wæ̣ wæ̆æ wæ̉ wæ̃ wæ̂.` (This or that, I, want.)


3.  **`wæ̀æ`**: But, However (Contrastive Conjunction)
    *   **Derivation:** `wæ̀` (state/contrast) + `æ` (suffix marker). Implies a contrast or opposition.
    *   **Function:** Connects contrasting ideas.
    *   **Example:** `wæ̃ wæ̂ wæ̀æ wæ̈ wæ̀ wæ̂.` (I am-good but you are-not-good.)


4.  **`wǽæ`**: Because, So, Therefore (Causal Conjunction)
    *   **Derivation:** `wǽ` (action/cause) + `æ` (suffix marker). Implies a causal relationship.
    *   **Function:** Indicates cause or result.
    *   **Example:** `wæ̃ wǽǽ wǽæ wæ̃ wæ̂.` (I acted-past, because/so I am-happy.)


5.  **`wæ̌æ`**: If, When (Conditional/Temporal Conjunction)
    *   **Derivation:** `wæ̌` (see/perceive/condition) + `æ` (suffix marker).
    *   **Function:** Introduces a conditional or temporal clause.
    *   **Example:** `wæ̈ wǽ wæ̌æ wæ̃ wǽǣ.` (You act, if/when, I will-act.)


6.  **`wæ̃̈`**: Interrogative Particle (Question Marker)
    *   **Derivation:** Combination of `wæ̃` (I) and `wæ̈` (you), evoking an inquiry between speaker and listener.
    *   **Function:** Placed at the end of a sentence to mark it as a yes/no question. Can also appear with Wh-question words.
    *   **Example:** `wæ wæ̃ wǽ wæ̃̈?` (Thing, I, do?) -> "Do I do the thing?"


7.  **`wæ̂!`**: Exclamatory/Hortative Particle
    *   **Derivation:** `wæ̂` (good/positive) used emphatically.
    *   **Function:** Expresses exclamation, strong affirmation, or a suggestion ("Let's!").
    *   **Example:** `wǽ wæ̂!` (Let's do! / Let's go!)

## III. Grammar


### A. Word Order


*   **Fundamental Order:** Object - Subject - Verb (OSV). This is the canonical order for declarative sentences.
    *   `wæ̂wæ wæ̃ wǽǽ.` (Food, I, ate-past.) -> "I ate the food."
*   **Adverbial Placement:** Adverbial phrases (time, place, manner) are relatively flexible but often appear at the beginning of the clause or before the verb.
    *   `wæ̉ wæ̂wæ wæ̃ wǽǽ.` (Then, food, I, ate-past.) -> "Then I ate the food."
    *   `wæ̂wæ wæ̃ wæ̣ wǽǽ.` (Food, I, here, ate-past.) -> "I ate the food here."
*   **Indirect Objects:** Often handled by context or by using a specific verb that implies an indirect object, or by serial verb constructions. Sometimes, the indirect object can appear before the direct object if it's topicalized.
    *   `wæ̈ wæ̂wæ wæ̃ wǽǽ.` (You, food, I, gave-past.) -> "I gave you the food." (Here, `wæ̈` is the recipient/indirect object).
*   **Emphasis:** While OSV is standard, fronting an element (moving it to the beginning of the sentence before the object) can emphasize it. The verb nearly always remains final in declarative clauses.


### B. Parts of Speech Fluidity


This is a core feature of DWL. Most `wæ`-forms (Core Words and many from the Written Vocabulary) are not intrinsically locked into one part of speech. Their grammatical role is determined by:
1.  **Position in the sentence:** Especially the final position for verbs.
2.  **Affixes:** Prefixes and suffixes can clarify or shift function.
3.  **Context:** The surrounding words and the overall meaning of the discourse.


*   **Example with `wæ̂` (good/positive):**
    *   Noun: `wæ̂ wæ̃ wæ̀.` (Goodness, I, have.) -> "I have goodness."
    *   Adjective: `wæ̂ wæ wæ̃ wǽ.` (Good thing, I, make.) -> "I make a good thing."
    *   Verb: `wæ wæ̃ wæ̂.` (Thing, I, like/consider-good.) -> "I like the thing."
    *   Adverb: `wæ wæ̃ wæ̂ wǽ.` (Thing, I, well, do.) -> "I do the thing well." (Here `wæ̂` modifies `wǽ`).


### C. Nouns


*   **Formation:** Any core `wæ`-form or Written Vocabulary item can function as a noun. Abstract nouns are often the direct `wæ`-form (e.g., `wæ̂` - goodness), while concrete nouns might use the Written Vocabulary or be `wæ` specified by adjectives.
*   **Pluralization:**
    *   Primary method: Prefix `wǣ-` (many).
        *   `wǣ wæ` (many things)
        *   `wǣ wæ̃wæ̇` (many people)
    *   Context can also imply plurality if `wǣ-` is absent but the meaning is clear.
*   **Articles:** DWL does not have explicit definite ("the") or indefinite ("a/an") articles. Definiteness is inferred from context, demonstratives, or prior mention.
*   **Demonstratives:** `wæ̣` (this/these) and `wæ̉` (that/those) precede the noun.
    *   `wæ̣ wǣ wæ` (these many things)
*   **Case:** DWL is primarily an analytic language. Grammatical roles (subject, object) are indicated by word order (OSV), not by case endings on nouns.
*   **Genitive/Possession:**
    *   Pronouns: Possessive pronoun precedes the noun: `wæ̃ wæ` (my thing).
    *   Nouns: The possessor noun precedes the possessed noun.
        *   `wæ̃wæ̇ wæ` (the person's thing).
        *   `Waluigi wæ̂wæ` (Waluigi's food).


### D. Adjectives


*   **Formation:** Any core `wæ`-form or Written Vocabulary item that can describe a quality can function as an adjective.
*   **Placement:** Adjectives typically precede the noun they modify.
    *   `wæ̂ wæ` (good thing)
    *   `wǣ wæ̆ wæ` (big small thing - a big thing that is also small in another aspect, or a thing that is "big-small")
*   **Comparison:**
    *   **Comparative:** Use `wǣ` (more/bigger) or `wæ̆` (less/smaller) before the adjective, often with a standard of comparison introduced by a phrase.
        *   `wæ wæ̃ wǣ wæ̂.` (Thing, I, am more good.) -> "I am better."
        *   To compare X to Y: `X Y wǣ wæ̂ wæ̀.` (X, Y, more good, is.) -> "X is better than Y." (Y is the standard).
    *   **Superlative:** Use `wǣ wǣ` (very much/most) or by context implying "most among a group."
        *   `wæ wæ̃ wǣ wǣ wæ̂.` (Thing, I, am most good.) -> "I am the best."
*   **Derivation:** Adjectives are often inherent in the core `wæ`-forms. They can also be formed from verbs or nouns contextually. For example, a verb in an adjectival position can act like a participle: `wǽ wæ` (acting thing / thing that acts).


### E. Verbs


*   **Formation:** Any core `wæ`-form or Written Vocabulary item can function as a verb, typically appearing as the final element in a clause.
*   **Valency:**
    *   **Intransitive:** Subject - Verb. `wæ̃ wǽ.` (I act.)
    *   **Transitive:** Object - Subject - Verb. `wæ wæ̃ wǽ.` (Thing, I, do.)
    *   **Ditransitive (e.g., give):** Often IndirectObject - DirectObject - Subject - Verb, or by using serial verb constructions or specific verbs from the Written Vocabulary that imply multiple arguments.
        *   `wæ̈ wæ̂wæ wæ̃ wǽǽ.` (You [IO], food [DO], I, gave-past.)
*   **Tense/Aspect:** Marked by suffixes (`-ǽ`, `-ǣ`, `-æ̀`) or lack thereof (see Section II.B.2).
*   **Mood:**
    *   **Indicative:** Default mood for statements.
    *   **Imperative:** Often formed by using the bare verb form, sometimes with `wæ̈` (you) omitted if clear. The particle `wæ̂!` can add hortative/suggestive force.
        *   `wæ wǽ!` (Thing, do!) -> "Do the thing!"
        *   `wǽ wæ̂!` (Let's go/do!)
    *   **Subjunctive/Conditional:** Often handled by conditional conjunctions like `wæ̌æ` (if/when) followed by a standard clause.
        *   `wæ̈ wǽ wæ̌æ wæ̃ wǽǣ.` (You act, if, I will-act.)
*   **Voice:**
    *   **Active:** The default voice, indicated by OSV order.
    *   **Passive-like constructions:**
        *   Using the stative/resultative suffix `-æ̀`: `wæ wǽæ̀.` (The thing is done/in a state of having been acted upon.)
        *   Omitting the agent (subject) if unknown or unimportant: `wæ wǽǽ.` (The thing was done.)
        *   Using `wæ̀` (to be) with a past participle-like form (often a verb with `-ǽ` used adjectivally): `wæ (wǽǽ) wæ̀.` (The thing is acted-upon.)
*   **Serial Verb Constructions:** DWL can use sequences of verbs to express complex actions or nuances.
    *   `wæ wæ̃ wǽ wæ̂.` (Thing, I, do make-good.) -> "I do the thing well / I improve the thing by doing."
    *   `wæ̃ wǽ wæ̌.` (I go see.) -> "I go to see."


### F. Pronouns


*   **Personal Pronouns:** `wæ̃` (I), `wæ̈` (you), `wæ̇` (he/she/it/they). See Section II.A.
*   **Possession:**
    *   Attributive: Possessive pronoun precedes the noun: `wæ̃ wæ` (my thing).
    *   Predicative: "The thing is mine" -> `wæ wæ̃ wæ̀.` (Thing, mine, is.) or `wæ̃ wæ wæ wæ̀.` (My thing, the thing, is.)
*   **Reflexive:** Often expressed by using the pronoun `wæ̃` (self) as an object or in conjunction with a verb.
    *   `wæ̃ wæ̃ wæ̌.` (Myself, I, see.) -> "I see myself."
    *   The prefix `wæ̃-` can also indicate self-action: `wæ̃-wǽ` (to self-do, to act upon oneself).
*   **Reciprocal:** "Each other" can be expressed by using plural pronouns and context, or a construction like "Person A, Person B, they-act-together."
    *   `wæ̃ wæ̈ wæ̂.` (I, you, like.) and `wæ̈ wæ̃ wæ̂.` (You, I, like.) implies reciprocity.
    *   A compound like `wæ̃wæ̈-wǽ` (I-you-act) could develop.


### G. Negation


*   **Primary Method:** The prefix `wæ̀-` (not-).
    *   Applied to nouns/adjectives: `wæ̀ wæ̂` (bad).
    *   Applied to verbs: `wæ wæ̃ wæ̀ wǽ.` (Thing, I, not-do.)
*   **Scope:** The negation prefix `wæ̀-` typically applies to the word it is directly attached to. For clausal negation, it attaches to the main verb.
*   **No Negative Words:** DWL avoids inherently negative words (e.g., "no," "never"). "No" as a response can be `wæ̀ wæ̂` (not good/not yes) or simply `wæ̀`. "Never" could be `wǣ wæ̀ wǽ` (long-time not-do).


### H. Questions


*   **Yes/No Questions:** Add the interrogative particle `wæ̃̈` at the end of an OSV statement.
    *   `wæ wæ̃ wǽ wæ̃̈?` (Thing, I, do?)
*   **Wh-Questions (Content Questions):** Use a relevant core `wæ`-form as an interrogative pronoun/adverb in the object (or relevant) position, usually followed by `wæ̃̈`.
    *   **What (thing)?** `wæ wæ̈ wǽ wæ̃̈?` (What-thing, you, do?)
    *   **Who (person)?** Use `wæ̃wæ̇` (person) or contextually `wæ` if "who" is clear. `wæ̃wæ̇ wæ wǽǽ wæ̃̈?` (Who, thing, did?)
    *   **Why (reason/cause)?** `wǽ wæ wæ̈ wǽǽ wæ̃̈?` (What-cause/action, thing, you, did?) -> "Why did you do the thing?"
    *   **Where (place)?** `wæ̣wæ̉ wæ̈ wǽ wæ̃̈?` (What-place, you, go?)
    *   **When (time)?** `wǣwǽ wæ̈ wǽǣ wæ̃̈?` (What-time, you, will-go?)
    *   **How (manner)?** `wǽ wæ wæ̈ wǽ wæ̃̈?` (What-action/manner, thing, you, do?) -> "How do you do the thing?"
*   **Intonation:** Spoken questions typically have a rising intonation towards the end, especially on `wæ̃̈`.

They adhere to all standard grammatical rules, including fluid part-of-speech. Each entry includes:
*   **DWL Word**
*   **Etymological Breakdown:** (e.g., `wæ̃` [Self] + `wǽ` [Active])
