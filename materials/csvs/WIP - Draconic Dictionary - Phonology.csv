- all vowels have retracted tongue root before or after laryngeal consonants,,,,Stress,,,,,/l/,[l̥] word-initially and before voiceless obstruents
- short vowels are slightly more lax and central than long vowels,,,,"- stress of a word is initially determined by it's root, ignoring all prefixes/suffixes",,,,,/r/,[r̥] word-initially and before voiceless obstruents
